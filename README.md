### my snake js

#### hello there! ðŸ‘‹

This is a time for making my very own version of this classic retro game.
Created with pure JS with elements of HTML5 Canvas.

* use the arrow keys on your keyboard to play the game
* increase your score by eating food 
* eat the food but don't your own tail!
* you can move through the walls
* mobile devices not supported

How long can you survive?
